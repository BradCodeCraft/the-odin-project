# Problem Solving

> Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of
> tasks and meets all stated constraints.

The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by
making lots of programs.

## Understand the problem

To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword
it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps.

## Plan

Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:

- Does your program have a UI? What will it look like? What functionality will the
  interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
- What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input
  from somewhere else?
- What's the desired output?
- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

## Pseudocode

**Pseudocode** is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead
of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have
to go through to solve the problem.

## Divide and conquer

Each of the steps in the algorithm we wrote out in the last section are sub-problems.
Pick the smallest or simplest one and start there with coding.

Getting started with and solving one of the sub-problems you have identified in
the planning stage often reveals the next sub-problem you can work on.
