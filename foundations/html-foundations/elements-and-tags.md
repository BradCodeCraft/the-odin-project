# Elements and Tags

## Elements and tags

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening
and closing HTML tags.

Opening tags tell the browser that this is the start of an HTML element.

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends.

You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing tags
tell the browser what content the element contains.

Using the correct elements for content is called **semantic HTML**.

## Void Elements

**Void elements** do not have a closing tag because they are void of any content.
