# Working with Text

## Paragraphs

If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element,
which will add a new line after each of our paragraphs.

## Headings

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger
and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.

Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a hierarchy
to the content.

## Strong element

The `<strong>` element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as
important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual
impairments will rely on to use your website.

## Em element

The `<em>` element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on
the text, which again may affect things like screen readers.

## Nesting and Indentation

When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child
relationship between them.

Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings.

We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves
and other developers who will work with our HTML in the future.

## HTML comments

HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to _comment_ on our
code so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get some
context about something that might not be clear in the code.
