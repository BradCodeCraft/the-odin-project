# Computer Basics

## What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic device that manipulates information,
or data. It has the ability to **store**, **retrieve**, and
**process** data. You may already know that you can use a
computer to **type documents**, **send email**, **play games**,
and **browse the Web**. You can also use it to edit or create
**spreadsheets**, **presentations**, and even **videos**.

### Hardware vs Software

**Hardware** is any part of your computer that has a **physical
structure**. It also includes all of the computer's internal
parts.

**Software** is any **set of instructions** that tells the
hardware **what to do** and **how to do it**.

### What are the different types of computers?

Computers come in many shapes and sizes, and they perform
many different functions in our daily lives.

- Desktop computers
- Laptop computers
- Tablet computers
- Servers
- Other types of computers (i.e., **specialized computers**)

### PCs and Macs

## What is an operating system?

An **operating system** is the **most important software**
that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's **memory**
and **processes**, as well as all of its **software** and
**hardware**. It also allows you to **communicate** with
the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's
language. **Without an operating system, a computer is
useless**.

### The operating system's

Your computer's **operating system (OS)** manages all of
the **software** and **hardware** on the computer. Most
of the time, there are several different computer programs
running at the same time, and they all need to access your
computer's **central processing unit (CPU)**, **memory**,
and **storage**. The operating system coordinates all of
this to make sure each program gets what is needs.

### Types of operating system

The three most common operating systems for pcs are
**Microsoft Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

Modern operating systems use a **graphical user interface**,
or **GUI**. A GUI lets you use your mouse to click **icons**,
**buttons**, and **menus**, and everything is clearly
displayed on the screen using a combination of
**graphics** and **text**.

### Microsoft Windows

### macOS

### Linux

### Operating systems for mobile device

**Mobile devices** are different from desktop and laptop
computers, so they run os that are designed specifically
for mobile devices.

## What is an application?

Simply put, an **app** is a type of software that allows
you to **perform specific tasks**.

When you open an application, it runs inside the **os**
until you close it. Most of the time, you will have more
than on application open at the same time, which is known
**multi-tasking**.

### Desktop applications

There are countless desktop applications, and they falls
into several categories. Some are more **full featured** (
like **Microsoft Word**), while others may only do **one
or two things** (like a **clock** or **calendar** app).

- **Word processors** allow you to write a letter, design
  a flyer, and create many other types of documents.
- **Web browsers** is the tool you use to access
  the **Internet**.
- **Media players**
- **Games**

### Mobile apps

- **Gmail**
- **Instagram**
- **Duolingo**

### Installing new applications

## Open source vs Closed source software

Almost every piece of computer software is created
using **source code**, which is the technical blueprint
that tells a program how to function.

### What is open source and closed source?

With **closed source software** (also known as proprietary
software), the public is not given access to the source
code, so they can't see or modify it in any way.

But with **open source software**, the source code is
publicly available to anyone who wants it, and programmers
can read or change that code if they desire.

### Which type is more common?

The **vast majority** of apps, games, and other popular
software is closed source. However, there are **open source
options** for many types of programs.

### What are the pros and cons?

One of the open source's biggest advantages is that it's
**usually free**, although some features and technical support
may cost extra. Also, because the code is available to
anyone who wants it, **public collaboration** can fix bugs,
add features, and improve performance within a relatively
short amount of time.

However, **it may not be as user friendly** as closed
source software, and if you run into trouble, it may be
difficult to find technical support, especially for less
popular programs.

Closed source software is more likely to be a **stable,
focused product**, and if you need support customer
service is typically easier to access. However, closed
source software **often costs money**, and if it has
any bugs or missing features you'll have to wait on the
creator to address the problems.

## Taking screenshots

Screenshots are captured by a **screenshot application** or
through **keyboard shortcuts**.

### Taking screenshots in macOS

#### Using the Application

Launchpad > Screenshot

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

**Shift + Command + 3**: entire screen
**Shift + Command + 4**: partial screen

### Taking screenshots in Windows

#### Using the Application

Depending on which version of Windows you're using, the
built-in application is either called **Snipping Tool** or
**Snip & Sketch**.

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

**Print Scrn**: entire screen
**Alt + Print Scrn**: active window or dialog box

### Taking screenshots on mobile devices

## Creating strong passwords

To protect yourself and your information, you'll want to use
passwords that are **long**, **strong**, **and difficult for
someone else to guess** while still keeping them relatively
**easy for you to remember**.

### Why do I need a strong password?

**Hacking**

### Tips for creating strong passwords

**Never use personal information**

**Use a longer password**

**Don't use the same password for each account**

Try to include **numbers**, **symbols**, and both **uppercase**
and **lowercase letters**.

Avoid using words that can be **found in the dictionary**.

**Random passwords are the strongest**.

### Common password mistakes

Some of the most commonly used passwords are based on
**family names**, **hobbies**, or just a **simple pattern**.

### Using password managers

You can use a **password manager** to store passwords securely
online.
