# Testing Routes and Controllers

## Introduction

## Routes testing with supertest

The most important, basic requirement for testing something in your code is
that it must be in an exported module. This is true for both custom middleware
and your routes/controllers, so the very first thing you need to do is separate
those things into their own modules, if they arenâ€™t already.

`npm install supertest --save-dev`
