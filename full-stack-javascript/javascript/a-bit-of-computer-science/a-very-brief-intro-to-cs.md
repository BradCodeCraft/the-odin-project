# A Very Brief Intro to CS

In the world of programming, there's a difference between solving a problem the
brute force way and solving a problem WELL.

Figuring out the best code to write becomes particularly important whenever you
start working with large data sets.

### [What is an Algorithm?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_WfC8HwVB8)

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions

#### What part do algorithms play in modern web development, specifically, user based web sites?

For your typical website, algorithms are mostly not necessary.

Algorithms become important in web development when you have a lot of data that
you have to process or when you are performing complicated transformations on
that data. Algorithms let you figure out efficient ways to handle large amounts
of data.

Algorithms also let you handle complicated transformations on data.

#### Are algorithms becoming an essential characteristic of modern user populated web apps?

The nature of user-populated web apps is that they have the potential to grow
very big.

### [What is Pseudocode?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg-fO7rDsds)

**Pseudocode** is an english-like way to state an algorithm.

#### Data

The **entire** software industry is based on data.

#### What are data structures?

Primitive data structures

How do you store data efficiently and save memory? Data structures help with
this problem.

Effieciently = performance + memory

Array, Set, Linked List

It's about when to use which data structure.

DSA helps cut down cost and improve UX.

Data structures are a way to store data efficiently.
