# Organizing Your JavaScript Code Introduction

## Organizing your JavaScript code

The reason this can be so overwhelming is *not* because JS is so much more
complex than other languages, but because it is incredibly forgiving! Many
languages force you into using specific patterns and data structures in your

The patterns we'll be covering in this series are:

- Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
- Factory Functions and the module Pattern
- Classes
- ES6 Modules
