# What is ES6?

## Introduction

## ECMAScript

It included _many_ new features that make writing JS much easier and cleaner.

### Release schedule

Instead of a single new version containing a huge number of new features (as
was the case with ES6 and before), verseions are now released annually with a
smaller set of additions per version.

## Browser support

The _problem_ with JS constantly updating and adding features is that it
sometimes takes web browsers a while to catch up and implement new features
once they've been released. This means, unfortunately, that if you write code
using brand new features, it **will not run** in browsers that do not support
it.

### Babel

**Babel** is a tool taht takes your modern JS code and **transpiles** it to
code that older browsers can understand. It can be set to transpile to meet any
number of targets, where the necessary targets depend on things like the
product's purpose, its target audience, etc.
