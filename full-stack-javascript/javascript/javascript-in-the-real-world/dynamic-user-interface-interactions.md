# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

## Introduction

## Drop-down menus

Drowdowns are typically comprised of two main parts:

1. A button that toggles the dropdown content's visibility
1. The dropdown content itself

The dropdown toggle button should typically only trigger the visibility of the
dropdown content on click, while the dropdown contents should typically only
contain items that will trigger an action upon clicking them.

## Image carousel

Image carousels are great for advertising, showcasing things, showing several
things using limited screen size, and can acutally be made using things you've
already learned. They are also highly customizable.

Typically, they consist of a div that acts as the "picture frame", where behind
that div, there is another much wider dive containing the carousel's images.
This strip of images can then move behind the picture frames, showing a
different image depending on what part of the strip is visible.
